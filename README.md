## About The Project

Music recommendation systems are becoming increasingly
popular as a way to help users discover new music that they might
enjoy. These systems use machine learning algorithms to analyze
user listening habits and recommend songs that are similar to their
preferences. The project at hand is a machine learning-based
music recommendation system that uses song metadata and user
listening history to make personalized song recommendations to
users.

The system uses collaborative filtering, a popular machine
learning technique, to identify similarities between users and make
recommendations based on listening history. Additionally, the
system also takes into account song metadata such as key, genre,
danceability, mode, and tempo to further improve the accuracy of
recommendations. By combining user listening history with song
metadata, the system can provide more personalized and accurate
recommendations.

The primary goal of the project is to enhance the user experience
by providing accurate and engaging recommendations that cater to
individual user preferences. The system aims to increase user
engagement and satisfaction with the music platform by offering
recommendations that are tailored to their unique taste in music.
The use of machine learning and song metadata is expected to
improve the accuracy of recommendations and provide a more
engaging listening experience for users.

Additionally, Genre prediction is the task of automatically identifying
the genre of a given piece of text or media. It plays an important role
in various fields, such as music and movie recommendation systems,
content tagging, and digital marketing. This task can be approached
through different methods, such as machine learning algorithms and
natural language processing techniques.

## Built With

The Project was made using Machine Learning Models of Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forest and Clustering using linear_kernel, euclidean distance and cosine_similarity.
